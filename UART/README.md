# UART 
UART, or universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter, is one of the most used device-to-device communication protocols.
UART is a serial communication device that performs parallel to serial data conversion at the transmitter side and serial to parallel data conversion at the receiver side. It is universal because the parameters like transfer speed, data speed, etc. are configurable.
